This is a documentation that checks the workings of function print_square(size)
size is the width/length of the square

these are test cases where there are normal inputs thus expecting normal outputs
>>> print_square=__import__("4-print_square").print_square
>>> print_square(3)

these are test cases where there are no normal inputs and are being checked if they are handled correctly

#when size is a string
>>> print_square("g")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: size must be an integer

#when size is less than 0
>>> print_square(-3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: size must be >= 0

#when size is int inf
>>> print_square(int("inf"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'inf'

#when size is None
>>> print_square(None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: size must be an integer

#when no argument is passed
>>> print_square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
